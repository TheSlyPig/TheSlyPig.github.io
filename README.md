# Escape-the-Core

A fast-paced psuedo-rhythm game where the user must find the gaps in the enclosing shapes to escape the core.

Inspired by Terry Cavanagh's Hexagon - https://terrycavanaghgames.com/hexagon/

## Features
1. The player controls a small triangle that can orbit the center hexagon by pressing the left and right keys.
2. Shapes (mainly hexagons, but with some alternative shapes) close in on the player, but always leave one open space the player can slip through.
3. The player dies and must restart upon collision with any of the shapes.
4. Music plays in the background.
5. Sound effects, including an encouraging voice-over every 10 seconds
6. The color scheme is constantly changing.
7. The entire canvas rotates semi-randomly.
8. The player wins if they survive for 60 seconds, but may keep playing until they die.
9. The game gets noticeably harder after 60 seconds.
10. BONUS: Multiple levels of increasing difficulty

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will use vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, along with the Canvas library.
