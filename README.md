2. Shapes close in on the player, but always leave one open space the player can slip through.
3. The player dies and must restart upon collision with any of the shapes.
4. Music plays in the background.
5. Sound effects, including an encouraging voice-over every 10 seconds
6. The color scheme is constantly changing.
7. The entire canvas rotates semi-randomly.
8. The player wins if they survive for 60 seconds, but may keep playing until they die.
9. The game gets noticeably harder after 60 seconds.
10. Multiple levels of increasing difficulty, that are unlocked by beating the previous level.
